# Open-source design system built in Sketch

Hi mates! 

So, it's the beginning of a project I was about to start several last years.

Open Source Design System, I am doing right now have the aim to help designers with a robust tool to start and handle complex UI products.

At the moment, I'm at the first steps of building a core, it has several linked libraries.

Also, I will be very thankful if you will support this project via Patreon.
